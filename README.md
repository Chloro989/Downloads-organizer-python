# Downloads-organizer
 I made this project for the purpose of organizing my Donwloads-folder.
 The script creates several folders in Downloads and moves files with specific extensions to their corresponding folder.
 Folders that are downloaded are also automaticly moved to the 'FOLDERS' folder.
 The script is very easy to addapt to suit your needs, so feel free to tinquer with it.
 
 I also included an .exe version of the script, which I made with pyinstaller.
 I personnally put the file in my startup folder so that it automaticly organizes my files when I log in on my computer.
 
 This is my first project to be posted on github. So adjust your expectations accordingly please :) .
## Requirements
 The script only uses standard python modules so there is no need to install aditional modules.
 The script itself requires a Python interpreter to run. I normally run it in my IDE.
 The .exe version of the script does not require python to be installed on your computer.
